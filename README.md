- On a side note: if you search my code online you might find it posted elsewhere. I did enjoy using 
Kattis this semester and made a public repo with my code (https://github.com/CRStromberg/Kattis). 
That being said they still needed to be modified for your requirements. I just don't want you to think 
I cheated. I wrote two of the three programs shortly after signing up for Kattis.
